## Getting Started

Welcome to **Static**, the static site generator that brings joy back into building simple and stylish websites. 

Remember the days of <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/an-ode-to-geocities/" target="_blank" class="text-yellow-400">GeoCities</a> and retro-styled websites? Creation of these websites were fun and simple, and we're here to help you rediscover that joy and simplicity. Here's the spiel:

- Static is **easy**. 
- HTML is **easy**. 
- Yet, somehow we lost the art of **crafting simple** Static HTML websites

No longer will this stand! **Static** is here to reclaim the throne of simplicity!

## Why Static

Here at the <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/an-ode-to-geocities/" target="_blank" class="text-yellow-400">DevDojo</a>, we've crafted websites of all sorts, from single page sites to full-blown monolith apps. Each time we set out to create a static site, all the solutions seemed overkill for most use-cases.

On a regular basis, we would run into NPM conflicts or wrestle configs from our current SSG (static site generator). SSG's had become a pain in the ass to deal with. We turned something simple into something needlessly complicated. We might have been better off creating static folders and index.html files.

This got us thinking about the main reason we reach for a static site generator in the first place. It's because we want to take advantage of shared layouts and reusable code. What if we created something that was centered around re-useable code (includes) and HTML structures (layouts). It's Simple, It's Static... It's just so Stupid easy that it just might work!

Static was born ðŸ‘¶

> Static is not your traditional SSG. Oh no! It's so much more. It's a Stupidly Super Simple Static Site Generator. It's an SSSSSG!

problem is that we can't create re-usable headers, footers, and other snippets.
